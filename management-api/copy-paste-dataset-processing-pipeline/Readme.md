# Copy/Paste a dataset processing pipeline

*WARNING : This collection is not a feature of Opendatasoft and is only a experimental tool that allows you to work efficiently with the Beta API Management in a graphical interface.*

This Postman collection is designed to help you copy and paste the entire processing pipeline from a dataset to another. 
The source dataset's domain and destination dataset's domain must not necessarily be the same. This collection is therefore useful for dataset migration. 

You can download [the collection here](20210901%20-%20Copy%20Paste%20-%20Processing%20pipeline.postman_collection.json). Please read the description of the collection in Postman before running it.
