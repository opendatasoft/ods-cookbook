# Edit metadata in Bulk with API Management

*You must have API management activated on your domain in order to update metadata in bulk. If this is not the case, contact your CSM or the support to ask for its activation.*

## STEP 1 : Create your data file of new metadatas by following the [How to](https://github.com/opendatasoft/ods-cookbook/blob/master/management-api/update-metadata-in-bulk/How%20to%20-%20Update%20multiple%20metadata%20at%20once.pdf "How to - Update multiple metadata at once") - Recap below

### Option 1 (Google Sheets)

1. Create and configure a "domaindatasets://" dataset. If you don't know how to do so, please read the [documentation](https://help.opendatasoft.com/platform/en/publishing_data/04_configuring_a_source/connectors/dataset_of_datasets.html "domaindatasets ODS documentation").
2. In the export tab of this dataset, export as a CSV the datasets for which you want to update the metadatas
3. Import this file in a Google Sheet, and specify a ";" separator (or "," if you have configured this separator on your domain)
4. Change the metadata values within your google sheet, delete all the columns of metadata you do not wish to update, then export it as a CSV with comma separated values
5. Send this CSV file to your CSM or run yourself the Postman collection in this folder entitled ["Metadata changes - Update multiple metadata values at once.json"](https://github.com/opendatasoft/ods-cookbook/blob/master/management-api/update-metadata-in-bulk/Metadata%20changes%20-%20Update%20multiple%20metadata%20values%20at%20once.postman_collection.json), with the CSV export as the datafile. Please read the collection description in Postman first.

### Option 2 (Libre Office)

1. Create and configure a "domaindatasets://" dataset. If you don't know how to do so, please read the [documentation](https://help.opendatasoft.com/platform/en/publishing_data/04_configuring_a_source/connectors/dataset_of_datasets.html "domaindatasets ODS documentation").
2. In the export tab of this dataset, export as a CSV the datasets for which you want to update the metadatas, and specify "," as the separator
3. Open this file with LibreOffice, choosing the UTF-8 encoding and the comma as the separator option (only the comma!).
4. Change the metadata values within LibreOffice, and save the new version.
5. Send this CSV file to your CSM or run yourself the Postman collection in this folder entitled ["Metadata changes - Update multiple metadata values at once.json"](https://github.com/opendatasoft/ods-cookbook/blob/master/management-api/update-metadata-in-bulk/Metadata%20changes%20-%20Update%20multiple%20metadata%20values%20at%20once.postman_collection.json), with the CSV export as the datafile. Please read the collection description in Postman first.

## STEP 2 : Run the Postman collection using the data file you just created

### Option 1

Send this CSV file to your CSM, who will apply the changes. Note that this action will require profesional services days.

### Option 2

Run yourself the Postman collection by following the [How to - Run the Metadata Postman Collection](https://github.com/opendatasoft/ods-cookbook/blob/master/management-api/update-metadata-in-bulk/How%20to%20-%20Run%20the%20Metadata%20Postman%20Collection.pdf "How to - Run the Metadata Postman Collection").
Following the instructions of the How To, run the collection in this folder entitled "Metadata changes - Update multiple metadata values at once.json", with the CSV export as the datafile. Please read the collection description in Postman first.
